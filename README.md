# README


This application is a learning management system. There are three types of users with different kinds of access and views:

General Users
        General users can only see 
        * the home page with links to sign up and log in 
        * an index of classes page
        
Students 
        Once signed up students can do the following from their home page:
                        edit their personal information,
                        see their current schedule,
                        see all comments they have made 
          
          
          They can see the following links: 
          Logout, 
          Links to individual classes they are taking and to individual teachers and to index of classes
          Edit Comment link for each individual commment they made
          
         
          if they click through to the individual class page they will have an opportunity to ask a question about the class, add comments to previous questions (as well as link to professor's individual page)

Final project for Flatiron School

An Angular front-end with a Rails back-end

Flatcasts

For my final project at Flatiron School's online campus, I decided to make something to ease a reoccurring problem: finding a lecture. It is all too common in our Slack channel to see someone looking for a particular lecture. There were Google docs but you could not always find the lecture you wanted.

Enter Flatcasts. A community maintained, one-stop shop for all Flatiron lectures. Lectures can be easily added to the database by simply entering in the YouTube URL and lecture topic. The lecture will then be able to be found on the lectures page. You can filter by topic or search for a particularly lecture. All lectures can be watched right on the site with the embedded YouTube.

Future features

 Github login
 Ability to favorite lectures
 Ability to mark a lecture as watched
 Ability to add notes
Bugs

If you find any issues or bugs, let me know about them on Twitter, or open up an issue here.
