Specs:

 [x] Use jQuery for implementing new requirements
 [x] Include a show resource rendered using jQuery and an Active Model Serialization JSON backend.
        Did this in a couple places - one example is that when the student is looking at their schedule they can click to see more information about the course.
 [x] Include an index resource rendered using jQuery and an Active Model Serialization JSON backend.
         Did this in a couple of places - one example is that when students are looking at their schedule they can also click a link to see all courses to see whether there are any others that they want to add.
 [x] Include at least one has_many relationship in information rendered via JSON and appended to the DOM.
          When students click to show more information about their course they also get to see the essential learnings for that course which are a separate model. Essential Learnings belong to a course and a course has many essential learnings.
 [x] Use your Rails API and a form to create a resource and render the response without a page refresh.
          This happens in two places - students can create enrollments by clicking a link which then adds that class to their schedule. Also instructors can create new courses which appends the new course info to that same page.
 [x] Translate JSON responses into js model objects.
          Created an ES5 function for courses. Used it for when instructors create a new course.
 [x] At least one of the js model objects must have at least one method added by your code to the prototype.
          When instructors create a new course, the html is generated by a protoype function.
