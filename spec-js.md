Specifications for the Rails with jQuery Assessment
Specs:

 Use jQuery for implementing new requirements


 Include a show resource rendered using jQuery and an Active Model Serialization JSON backend.
   - the student schedule page should have a summary of courses that have signed up for. Each course should have a link where the student can click and see more information about the courses

   - the main schedule page should have a summary of courses and should allow students to click and see details of the courses and then add a course to their schedule.  

 Include an index resource rendered using jQuery and an Active Model Serialization JSON backend.
   - going to do this with my teachers courses page where teachers can click and see the students enrolled in a particular course - i think this is basically done.




 Include at least one has_many relationship in information rendered via JSON and appended to the DOM.
  - when the students click to see details of the course they also get to see essential learnings for that course - Active Model Serializer is part of this somehow

 Use your Rails API and a form to create a resource and render the response without a page refresh.
  - I am going to go to the create course page and redirect through AJAX post to be able to make the new instance and append the info to the page without actually going through the browser


 Translate JSON responses into js model objects. -
 - I will use the create course page as an opportunity to create JS model objects. I have to go back watch the protoype video to see what that is all about

 At least one of the js model objects must have at least one method added by your code to the prototype.
 
Confirm

 You have a large number of small Git commits
 Your commit messages are meaningful
 You made the changes in a commit that relate to the commit message
 You don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message

 I'm planning on adding jquery and AMS in the course index and show.
